# PLStream Model Accuracy & Confidence Evaluation

This folder consists of Python code files used to  
- find the accuracy of PLStream model &
- evaluate the confidence of predictions made by the PLStream model

The csv files found in this folder contain essential parameters required to find the confidence intervals of correct and incorrect tweet predictions in terms of cosine similarity difference values. These files were exported from pseudo_dataset which can be found in *plstream_linear.ipynb* after performing data manipulation and cleaning as explained in the pseudo_dataset manipulation script.
