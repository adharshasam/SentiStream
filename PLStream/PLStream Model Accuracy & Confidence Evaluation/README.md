# PLStream Model Performance & Confidence Evaluation

This directory contains Python scripts used to evaluate the:
- performance of PLStream model based on the accuracy of its tweet sentiment predictions &
- confidence intervals for correct predictions in relation to their cosine similarity difference values

The csv files found in this folder contain essential parameters required to find the confidence intervals of correct and incorrect tweet predictions in terms of cosine similarity difference values. These files were exported from pseudo_dataset which can be found in *plstream_linear.ipynb* after performing data manipulation and cleaning as explained in the pseudo_dataset manipulation script.
