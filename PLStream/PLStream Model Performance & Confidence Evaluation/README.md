# PLStream Model Performance & Confidence Evaluation

**As an Undergraduate Student Researcher, I worked with the IntelliStream Research Group @ SUTD under the guidance of Prof. Shuhao Zhang who aimed to develop a novel, Apache Flink-based, semi-supervised online sentiment classification system – PLStream – which processes massive data streams incrementally, classifies text data (such as Twitter tweets or online product reviews) with or without labels as positive or negative text sentiments & scales linearly with increasing hardware resources.**

_The preprint of the research paper introducing describing the framework of PLStream can be accessed here:_ [arXiv:2203.12368](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12368) [cs.DB]

### My Role in the IntelliStream Research Group

As a UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme) Student, I was involved in the _‘Confidence Evaluation’_ segment of this NLP Research Project.

Using statistical & machine learning techniques in Python, I quantitatively evaluated the performance of the text sentiment classifier & calculated the 'confidence' of text sentiment predictions. 

During the course of this UROP project, I got good exposure to important concepts in Natural Languague Processing & also received the opportunity to get hands-on experience using Data Science Python packages shown below.

### Performance Evaluation of the Text Sentiment Classification System

★ Evaluated the performance of semi-supervised binary text sentiment classifier (a two-layer word2vec neural network + softmax activation function + categorical cross-entropy loss function) on labelled text data of over 380k entries using various model performance metrics such as: 

• Confusion Matrix (Accuracy, Precision, Recall)

• F1-Score   

• ROC Curve & AUC Score

• Precision-Recall Curve & Average Precision

• Silhouette Coefficient

• Calisnki-Harabasz Coefficient

for both supervised & unsupervised machine learning.

### 'Confidence' Evaluation of Text Sentiment Predictions

★ Performed **Two-Sample t-Test** to detect a statistically-signficant difference between the mean cosine similarity difference values and the correct & incorrect text sentiment predictions.

★ Approximated the Gaussian PDF of the frequencies of correct text sentiment predictions using **Kernel Density Estimation**.

★ Calculated **Confidence Intervals** of the true mean of the cosine similarity difference values for text sentiments accurately predicted by the sentiment classification system.

### Adhoc Tasks

★ **Literature Review of Relevant Research Papers** to brainstorm ways for a more robust **Data Stream Mining** (Stream Learning).
