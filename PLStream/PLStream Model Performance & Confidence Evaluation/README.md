# PLStream Model Performance & Confidence Evaluation

**As an Undergraduate Research Student, I worked under the guidance of Prof. Shuhao Zhang & his IntelliStream Research Team who aimed to develop a novel online sentiment classification system - PLStream - which processes data streams incrementally, classifies tweets with or without labels, & scales linearly with increasing hardware resources.**

## PLStream System Architecture

**I worked independently to quantitatively assess the overall model performance & predictive accuracy of PLStream using various statistical techniques in Python.**

**Dataset of Population Sample** contained actual tweet sentiments & sentiment predictions of 5,60,000 tweets made by the PLStream binary classifier which is a two-layer word2vec neural network followed by a softmax activation function & a categorical cross-entropy loss function.

## Evaluation of PLStream Model Performance

● **Random Undersampling** & **SMOTE** techniques to fix binary class imbalance in the sample dataset containing true & predicted tweet sentiments.

● Experimented with different Performance Evaluation Metrics such as **Confusion Matrix**, **Accuracy**, **F1-Score**, **ROC AUC** & **PR AUC** to understand trade-offs & choose the best metric for the PLStream binary classifier.

## Data Wrangling & Manipulation of pseudo_dataset

The list form of *pseudo_dataset* found in *plstream_linear.ipynb* contains valuable information which could help us derive valuable insights on quantitatively evaluating PLStream model performance.

**Data format :** [index,|cosine similarity difference|, predicted label,{neg_coefficient,pos_coefficient,true_label,'cos_sim_bad','cos_sim_good'}]

To make the data easier to work with, conversion of the data to a data frame format containing cosine similarity difference and correct guess values was performed.

● **Student's t-test** to discover a statistically-significant difference between mean cosine similarity difference values for correct & incorrect tweet sentiment predictions.

● **Kernel Density Estimation** to discover the underlying Normal Probability Density Function of the frequency of correctly predicted tweets for their corresponding cosine similarity difference values.

● **Confidence Intervals** of the true means of the cosine similarity difference values for correct & incorrect tweet predictions made by PLStream model.
