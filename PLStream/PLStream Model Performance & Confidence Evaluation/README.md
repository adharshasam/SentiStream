# PLStream Model Performance & Confidence Evaluation

**This folder contains all my contributions for the Data Science Research project - Online Sentiment Classification Of Massive Data Streams - as an Undergraduate Research Student at SUTD.**

Worked with a train.csv dataset containing actual tweet sentiments & sentiment predictions of 5,60,000 tweets made by the PLStream classifier which is a two-layer word2vec neural network followed by a softmax activation function & a categorical cross-entropy loss function.

## Evaluation of PLStream Model Performance

- Fixed binary class imbalance in the dataset using *Random Undersampling* & *SMOTE* techniques.

- Studied the trade-offs among Performance Evaluation Metrics such as *Confusion Matrix*, *Accuracy*, *F1-Score*, *ROC AUC* & *PR AUC* and recommended suitable performance metrics to accurately evaluate the performance of PLStream binary classifier, also considering its pros and cons.

## Data Wrangling & Manipulation of pseudo_dataset

The list form of *pseudo_dataset* found in *plstream_linear.ipynb* contains valuable information which could help us derive valuable insights on quantitatively evaluating PLStream model performance.

Data format : [index,|cosine similarity difference|, predicted label,{neg_coefficient,pos_coefficient,true_label,'cos_sim_bad','cos_sim_good'}]

To make the data easier to work with, conversion of the data to a data frame format containing cosine similarity difference and correct guess values was performed.

## Confidence Evaluation of PLStream Classifier

- Carried out the *Student's t-test* and detected a statistically-significant difference between mean cosine similarity difference values for correct and incorrect tweet sentiment predictions.

- Discovered the underlying *Normal Probability Density Function* for the frequency of correctly predicted tweets in relation to their corresponding cosine similarity difference values.

- Calculated *Confidence Intervals* for the true means of the cosine similarity difference values for correct and incorrect tweet predictions made by the PLStream model.
